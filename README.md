# dsd project repo
PRIVATE School-Project about Distributed Systems.

## Usage (for dsd_project)

Main Branch: The code that is merged after being reviewed. The main branch code should always be runnable without errors.

Develop Branch: Branch where the code is pushed. This is the branch we push to after making changes to the code.

Feature Branch: Testing purposes, if we want to test a different concept. 

Dont forget to change to develop or feature branch before making changes to code. Always push to a "develop" or "feature" branch. Code will be reviewed by another in team to make sure its working properly before merging to the main branch. (Good practice to let someone else review your code, if change is minor, its okay to merge)

To stay updated with the latest code changes and collaborate effectively, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Update Your Local Branch**:
   - Regularly update your local branch with the latest changes from the remote repository. You can do this using the following command:
     ```
     git pull origin <branch-name>
     ```
   - Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you're working on (probably feature branch).
   - 
2. **Commit and Push Frequently**:
   - After each coding session or when you make significant changes, commit and push your changes to the repository (feature branch). This ensures that other participants can access your work and collaborate effectively. (Please also make sure your code is working, if not, create an issue)
   - Use descriptive commit messages to provide context about the changes you've made.
   - (To be able to review the code easier, and decide if we will merge it into the main branch, a good detailed description that explains the new change would be very helpful, to understand the contribution.)

3. **Collaboration**:
   - If you encounter any issues or have questions about the project, feel free to reach out to other participants or create an issue on the repository.
   - Collaboration is key to the success of the project, so make sure to communicate and coordinate with other contributors.

## Additional Information
